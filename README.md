<h2>About the Website</h2>

<p>It's a fully functional and user-friendly website dedicated to the Ultimate Frisbee Team from Timisoara.</p>

<p>The website's primary functionality is the merchandise shop, where users can add items to their cart or wishlist and then proceed to order by providing all the necessary delivery information. After placing an order, they can track the status of their order. Users can also contact the administrators using the message form.</p>

<p>Administrators have an easy-to-use interface for various tasks, including accepting orders, monitoring the shop's profits, checking the number of orders, reviewing the number of user accounts created, adding new products, managing user messages, and creating new admin accounts.
