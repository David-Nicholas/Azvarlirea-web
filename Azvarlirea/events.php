            <h3>FLIGHT FSTIVAL</h3>
            <p>Flight Festival is more than just a music festival: it is a cultural journey to multiple attractions in the fields of music, art and technology, a place for fun, where participants can develop new skills and gain valuable know-how. We set out to introduce the concept of edutainment in Romania and to transform Flight Festival into a multiverse in which festival-goers discover new things on their favorite beats.</p>

            <h3>PLAI FESTIVAL</h3>
            <p>PLAI was born from the desire of a community to create a festival like none they had found in the city. We are a community of dedicated volunteers committed to positive civic actions and social change. We are the volunteers who dreamed of an active cultural city and took action towards it. We are the dream that every young person has before growing up. </p>

            <h3>AZVARLIREA IN HIGHSCHOOLS</h3>
            <p>In the past, Timisoara's high schools came together for an unforgettable Ultimate Frisbee contest called 'ANOTHER DISC TROUGH THE WALL.' This historic event showcased the incredible athleticism and competitive spirit of our city's youth. It was a moment of pride and unity and also friendship. We tried to make people try new sports. </p>
